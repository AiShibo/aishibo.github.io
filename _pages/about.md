Thank for coming by! My name is Shibo Ai (艾诗博) and I am an undergraduate research assistant at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca), with [Dr. Hugo Lefeuvre](https://owl.eu.com/about.html) and [Professor. Margo Sentzer](https://www.seltzer.com/margo/). I will graduate in May 2026.

I love systems research! I am interested in operating systems, security and programming language. Specifically, I work on discovering new
computer system vulnerabilities, mitigating known vulnerabilities through systematic approaches, and designing safe-by-design
systems. 


### I am currently seeking a research Master or a Ph.D. position, starting fall 2026!!
