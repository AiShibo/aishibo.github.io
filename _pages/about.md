My name is Shibo Ai (艾诗博) and I am an undergraduate research assistant at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca), with [Prof. Margo Seltzer](https://www.seltzer.com/margo/) and [Dr. Hugo Lefeuvre](https://owl.eu.com/about.html). I will graduate in May 2026.

I love systems research! I am interested in operating systems, security and programming language. Specifically, I work on uncovering new
operating system vulnerabilities, systematic approaches for mitigation, and designing safe systems. 


### I am currently applying for a research Master's or a Ph.D. program, starting fall 2026.
